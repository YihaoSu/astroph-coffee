    <p>astroph-coffee is a small platform to view and vote on arXiv astro-ph
    papers, and helps to organize paper discussions. It's a bit
    like <a href="http://voxcharta.org">VoxCharta</a>, but much simpler, and can
    be fully installed on a local department server.</p>

    <p>The server's code is hosted
    on <a href="https://github.com/waqasbhatti/astroph-coffee">Github</a>, and
    it's meant to be simple to install and use. Please let Waqas Bhatti know if
    something doesn't look right, or is completely broken, or if you have
    questions. The email address to use is:</p>
