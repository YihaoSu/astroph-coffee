    <p>The Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University gathers
    to discuss the latest <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new">arXiv
    astro-ph</a> posting every week-day at 10:30 AM US Eastern Time over coffee
    (and donuts/bagels on Friday!). Visitors to the department are always
    welcome to join in these discussions.</p>

    <p>This <a href="/astroph-coffee/about">astro-coffee server</a> is meant to
    help organize the discussion. It automatically finds and highlights papers
    from local authors, and allows the community to vote for articles they want
    to talk about. New paper listings are fetched from the arXiv between 00:15
    and 00:25 UTC every week-night & Sunday night.</p>

    <p>Currently, voting on papers is open between the hours of
    <strong>{{ voting_localstart }}</strong> ({{ voting_start }})
    and <strong>{{ voting_localend }}</strong> ({{ voting_end }}). Everyone
    gets five votes (one per paper) to use as they please.</p>
