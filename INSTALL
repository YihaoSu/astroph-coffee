This file details how to install the astroph-coffee server. The server is mostly
self-contained, runs its own web-server listening to a port on the localhost
interface, and is meant to be used along with a frontend reverse-proxy (like
nginx). An example nginx .conf file is provided.

PREREQUISITES

You'll need the following already installed:

* sqlite3
* virtualenv

On a recent Linux distribution:

$ sudo yum install python-virtualenv sqlite3 (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS)

or

$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv sqlite3 (Debian/Ubuntu)

will do this for you.


INSTALLING THE ASTROPH-COFFEE SERVER

In the astroph-coffee directory:

$ make install

will make a virtualenv directory named "run" under the astroph-coffee directory
where the server will run from. The following directories will also be created:

* astroph-coffee/run/logs => logs go here
* astroph-coffee/run/pids => pids for the server processes go here
* astroph-coffee/run/data => the sqlite3 database for the server goes here

The Python dependencies will be automatically installed by pip. These include:

* tornado
* passlib
* requests
* BeautifulSoup4
* selenium
* pytz
* itsdangerous

Once the server is installed, you'll need to edit the
astroph-coffee/run/conf/astroph.conf file. In particular, you'll need to
generate the secret key used by the server for cookie signing and change the
values in the [times] section to match your location.
